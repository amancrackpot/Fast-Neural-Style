The model is a custom network trained on a subset of the Coco 2017 dataset. The code needed to recreate the training data 
and train the model is detailed in the Jupyter notebook in the notebooks directory.

Code for the web app is based on work by https://github.com/kheyer 
and [fastai](https://github.com/fastai/course-v3/tree/master/docs/production)
