# Neural Style Transfer

### Web App Available at https://fast-neural-style-app.onrender.com/
![demo](https://github.com/amancrackpot/Fast-Neural-Style/blob/master/Results/styler.gif)

#### The code needed to train the model is detailed in the https://github.com/amancrackpot/Fast-Neural-Style/blob/master/faststyletransfer.ipynb notebook.
Note: Training has been shown only for few styles to keep the size of ipynb file small

# What it is?
We are trying to transfer style of one image over another without loosing its content. Since a picture is worth than a thousand words, below are some results which will clearly demonstrate this
